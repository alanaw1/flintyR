Description: Given a multivariate dataset and some knowledge about 
              the dependencies between its features, it is important to 
              test if the samples are exchangeable especially before trying
              to fit a model on the dataset and to make inferences from it. 
              This package provides a flexible non-parametric test of 
              exchangeability, allowing the user to specify the feature dependencies
              by hand. See Aw, Spence and Song (2021) for the accompanying paper.
