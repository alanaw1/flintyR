The purpose of this vignette is to cover all the bases of our work. In particular, we will

- Explain how we generate TAD boundaries for analyzing 10X Single Cell ATAC-seq data 
- Demonstrate how our method works on data involving only independent sets of pairwise distances (see Section 4.1 of our paper)
- Provide a population genetics example of how to run our method from the terminal

If you've come here for the details, you're in the right place ðŸ™‚

# Generating Topologically Associating Domains for scATAC-seq Data Analysis
